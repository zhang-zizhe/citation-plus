# Citation-Plus
This is a simple plug-in to display your (or someone else's) Google Scholar citation when you open the terminal. (Just for fun!ðŸ¤ª)

## How to use:
First clone the repo in your home directory first.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zhang-zizhe/citation-plus.git
```
Then modify `fetch_citations.sh`, find
```bash
SCHOLAR_ID="YOUR_GOOGLE_SCHOLAR_ID"           # Your Google Scholar ID
```
and change it to your google scholar id.
(e.g. **0OY7JKAAAAAJ** is your id if the url of your google scholar page is https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0OY7JKAAAAAJ&hl=en).
