## How to use it

**1. Clone the repo**  
   ```bash
   cd ~
   git clone https://github.com/zhang-zizhe/citation-plus.git
   cd citation-plus
   ```

**2. Set your Scholar ID**
Open `fetch_citations.sh` (*e.g. with Vim*) and replace:
```bash
SCHOLAR_ID="YOUR_GOOGLE_SCHOLAR_ID"     # Your Google Scholar ID
```
and change it to your Google Scholar ID.

><small>*For example, if your Google Scholar URL is
https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0OY7JKAAAAAJ&hl=en,
then your Scholar ID is **0OY7JKAAAAAJ**,
set`SCHOLAR_ID="0OY7JKAAAAAJ"`(If any of my work sparks your curiosity, I’d be honored if you cited it! 🌹)*</small>

**3. Make the scripts executable**
```bash
chmod +x fetch_citations.sh
chmod +x show_citations_linux.sh      # or show_citations_mac.sh on macOS
```
**4. Test it**
```bash
./fetch_citations.sh
./show_citations_linux.sh      # or show_citations_mac.sh on macOS
```
You should see something like:
```
📖 Total citations: {x} (last 30 days +0)           #{x} should be the number of your citations.  
May your academic impact continue to grow! 💪       #you can modify the output style in the show_citations script.
```
**5. Auto-display on terminal open**
Add this to the end of your `~/.bashrc` or` ~/.zshrc`:
```bash
~/citation-plus/show_citations_linux.sh    # or show_citations_mac.sh
```
**6. Schedule daily updates**
One last thing is to automatically fetch your neweast citations everyday. A very simple way is to use *Cron*, which is a time-based job scheduler used on Unix-like operating systems including *Linux* and *macOS*.
```bash
crontab -e
```
Then append:
```
MAILTO=""
0 0 * * * $HOME/citation-plus/fetch_citations.sh
```
Fresh data will be fetched at midnight every day which ensures your total count and 30-day increase are updated automatically.
